GERGOVIA· ALESIA.

135. 1. o. 1. quieta Gallia, ‘the torrent’s smoothness ere it dash
below? In a. 35, 3. 28, Caesar had thought Gaul to be ‘quieta' and
‘pacata’ yet disturbances had followed. But now there was to be an
almost universal revolt, including even Caesar’s cherished Aedui. There
is a kind of sincen'ty‚ in Caesar’s copying, from his diary here and else-
where, expressions of opinion so much at variance with after circum·
stances '

2. da clodii caede. Worthless though he was, Clodius was a
partisan of Caesar, and therefore his death was an affair of importance.
The levies here alluded to were because Pompeius had declared the city
to be in a state of siege on account of the tumult raised by the multitude
for the loss of their favourite. ¹

3. oar-tim· factus, for ‘iussus :' see above, 3. 5, ‘certiores facit milites
paulisper proelium intermitterent:

6. addunt et affingunt, appended by their fictitious reports.

8. in tantis dissensionibus, prepositional ablative absolute. See
above, r. 33, note 3.

9. qui dolerent, the subjunctive (as in 5. 4, ‘qui iam ante in nos
inimico animo fuisset '), to express ‘whereas even before they had been
annoyed by their subjection to the Roman people.'

’ 13. ad ipsos, emphatic reflexive: ‘on themselves, however unlilrely
such an event might now appear!

15. praemiis deposcunt, &c., ‘they endeavoured by all kinds of pro-
mises and offers of reward, to induoe some one or other to come forward.

1³6. 6. ο. 2. Carnutes. This was one of the most important natiohs

s of Gaul. Chartres¹ andGenabum (Gien near Orleans) were their chief ,ᾗ
towns, the latter celebrated as an entrepot for the trade from the Saone
to the Loire. The wealth thus derived, together with the fact that
