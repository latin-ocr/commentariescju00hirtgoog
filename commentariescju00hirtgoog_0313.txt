Ocean which would gradually (as the climate ol Europe became milder
and the river lost volumel succeed in gaining upon the Rhine and
silting up its outlets in this direction. Thus the stream would be driven
farther south in search ol an issue. In the time ol the Roman em·
perors a balance still seems to have existed between the volume ol water
couveyed by the northern and southern mouths, the Waal and the
Rhine. For we find Civilis, the insurgent Batavian‚ destroying a darn
raised by Drusus near the embranchment oi these two rivers. The
object of the dam seems to have been to keep the waters lrom the Waal
chanuel aud direct them to the old Rhine; that oi Civilis to move the
frontier ol his country further south by drawing them back to the Waal.

11. Nantuates, as this nation (supra 3. 1) inhabited French Savqu
it is not easy to see how they can be east os the F urha. Strabo places
a nation called the ‘Aetuates' in the required position. Perhaps this

Cleves to' the neighbourhood ol Cologne, so as to retum in three days.
Yet the difficulty would be hardly less on the other supposition. as the
German cavalry would, then have had to get from the lower Mense to
Coblenz in the sarne time. It is possible either that ‘ad eas res con·
ficiendas’ may mean ⁴ in order to arrange lor the embassy,’ or that the
ambassadors wildly pressed lor these three days without closely consider-
ing what they promised to accomplish in them. Or finally, the narra·
tive may be deficient in good saith on Caesar’s part. See the following
notes.

27. eodem pertinere, ‘ tended to the same object.¹ Note the use ol
this word in r. 1. ‘Eodem' is ol course an adverb.
