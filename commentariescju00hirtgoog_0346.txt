noras. v1.16-19.' 299

travellingl: and this name closely resembles the name of Thoth‚ by
which the same divinity‚ the author os all arts. was known in the East
(Plato, Phaedr. § 274). T he God whom Caesar calls Mars was Hesus.
A figure of him and one probably of Taranis are given srom antique
sources in the Pict. Hist. of England, vol. t, p. 68. See also the passage
ol Lucan quoted at 6. 13. ⁴

8. Apollinem, that is, the Gallie god Belenis. Here we seem to
trace a strong resemblance between the two names, especially is the old
lorm Apello (Apellen) be taken. Βέλα was also the Spartan name tor
the Suu. ' ’

10. Minervam operum initia tradere: as Minerva was not a
Grecian but an Etruscan and Roman gooddess‚ her worship in Gaul may
have been ol the same character as in those countn‘es, She is, as her
name shows (Varron. p. 146), the suggester os all ideas, as Teutates or
Mercury developes ideas into arts. It is evident that the Gallie idea was
to worship both the outward power of nature and the inward ones of the
mind, divine and human.

20. o. 18. ab Dite prognatos, ‘sprung srom the realms of night ;'
that is, apparently, ‘aboriginal on their own soil’

22. numero noctium finiunt, the Germans, however, did the same
(as Tacit. Ger. c. 11, tells), and we, their descendants, still speak ol
‘sortnights ' as the Welshman calls a week ‘eight-nights.’ This reason
sor this mode of counting time may be guessed from Sophocles’ lines
(Trach. 94), bv αἰόλα νὺξ ἐναριζομένη τίκτει .. ,Ἅλιον αἰτῶ. This idea
is universal in mythology. '

27. assistere, ‘to place himself! The acc. ‘se' is understood as it
is with ‘consisto’ or as στρατὸν is with defidatur.

28. o. 19. dotis nomine: see 5. 5, note a.

31. fruetus serventur: this kind os settlement on the survivor must
have involved some sels-denialand saving power, and it implies a position
os authority aud digniry for wives. By Roman law in just the same way
the ‘dos’ contributed by the wife was osten met by a ‘donatio propter
nuptias '1 on the husband's part.

uter vita supereum whichever os the two outlives the other re·
ceives both ‘dos' and ‘donatio ;' with the interest which has accrued
from each during the time of the marriage. Probably the torturing os
widows mentioned immediately afterwards may have been in view of the
temptation imposed upon wives by· this custom.
