Norae. 1v. 18-22. 271

the real spot; as we may see by a comparison oi the itinerary in 6. ²9
loll, with the present passage. On the characteres the bridge, see
Manuale, vol. 1, p. 461, note; on the difficulty oi constructing it by the
labour of mere legionarias, Hyde's Fortification, ς 234.

16. o. 80. exigua parte reliqua, ‘although only a small part oi
the summer still remained! See 1. 33, note 4

¹7· ad septentriones vergit. The meaning seems to be the same
as in 1. 16, ‘Gallia sub septentrionibus posita est,’ ‘lies in a high
latitude.'

18· profloisei contendit, διο.. ‘arranged to go into Britain! Conr-
pare the sense of th'e words here with that of those in 1. 23, 1. 53, 3. 3.

23· Gallis erant incognita: the chief trade with Britain was in
the hands of the Veneti; and they, according to Strabo (4 271) were
anxious to thwart the expedition. Hence an ignorance probably as-
sumed.

²9· quem usum belli, ‘what degree oi practice in war!

3². o. 21. periculum faeere, ‘to make a trial! This sense results
literally from the derivation. Compare the sense ol ¹ peritus!

75. a. in Morinos3 this nation extends as sar up as the Scheldt;
but the ‘brevissimus traiectus· indicates that Caesar chose the Strait ol
Dover for this passage. As to the port, all later authorities are agreed
that it could only have been Boulogne. For this port was universaliy
used for embarkations to Britain under the emperors ; it is the only one
which has subsidiary ports at the distances mentioned by Caesam it was
the harbour to which the military roads led (see Bertrand’s Voies
Romaines, pp. 5, 6), and, finally, it is the only port anywhere near the
Strait of Dover which could hold fleets of anything like the size which
Caesar collected there. See the map at 5. 18.

8. polliceantur obsides dare: the future inf. is used in the next
chapter with ⁴ polliceor! Euphony would be against it in this passage.
For the verb, see r. 4²· note 3, which justifies the tense here used.

11. Atrebatibus superatis3 in the battle on the Sambre (a. 23).
The same nation occupied Berkshire in England; whence the supposed
influence ol Commius.

ι 5. fidem sequentur, ‘to submit to the allegiance?

²3· o. 22. homines barbari, ‘from being barbarians’ (1. 33, note y).
27. belli amnui, ‘for a regular war with them.¹ '
²9· Britanniae, διο.. ‘he thought that these small matters of occupab
tion ought not to be preferred to his Bn'tish enterprise:' literally‚ ‘to
Britain,’ by compendiary comparison. So ‘ave' is used ior ‘quam quod
. potest avis,’ in Ovid, Psittacus,
‘ora tuere milri plus ave docta loqu‘a’
