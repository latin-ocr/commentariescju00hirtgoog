252 nr sauro caturco

“ 8. a‘l. omnibus de causta δια, ‘Caesar thought lor all reasons that

Gaul was subdued (⁴paoatam' is euphemistic); unce the Belgae had
been defeated’ &c

9. expulsis Germanis, those ol Ariovistus. Kraner argues that
these cannot be meant, as only the last year's events are here alluded to.
But Caesar's meaning seems to be that he could go salely into Illyricum,
as Gaul was not likely to rise ol itsell, and the two disturbing causes ol
the Belgae and Ariovistus were now at rest, besides which the commu·
nication with his province was secure, as the Seduni had been reduced.

11. regiones cognoscem, ‘to ascertain the character ol the country!

¹3· P. crassum molesmum P. Crassus the younger. son of the
triumvir, and the friend of Cicero (Ep. ad Qu. Frat. a. 9).

so with the comparative in ‘plus dena milia passuum abesse‚’ and the
like phrases.

Andes, 'Anjou' ·

18. Coriosolitae, round Dinan and S. Malo. Several MSS. read
‘Unelli' for Esuvii‚' which the author ol Jules cesar follows. The
sense thus given is better; lor the Esuvii were in eastern Norrnandy
about Falaise‚ whereas the Unelli, occupying the Cotentiu from Arranches
to Cape la Hogue‚ are more naturally involved in this Breton wer. The
three nations here named extend quite across the peninsula ol Bretagne.

19. Veneti, near vannos, in Bretagne.

ao. ae. longe amplissime...omnis orae‚·very great indeed over all
that line ol coast! ‘Longe ’ with the superlative is generally in Caesar
the superlative absolute.

of great impetuosity! By a similar hypallage we have ‘mitis sapientia
Laeti: ‘the gentle and wise Laelius!

detaining Silius aud Velanius!

introduces an illustrative assertion.

32. eundem¹ . ‚fortunae exitum . . laturos, ‘they resolved that they
would share in common any result which might occur!

33· quem a maioribus acceperant3 why uot ‘accepissentl'

54. 4. obsides sibi remittet, oblique imperative, when the oblique
takes the dramatic form so as to retain the tenses used by the speaker.
Otherwise the imperfect would be used, as in 1. 36, ‘cum vellet congre-
deretur: ‘let him attack when he chose!
