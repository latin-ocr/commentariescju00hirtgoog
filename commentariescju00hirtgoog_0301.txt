on Mod. Hist. p. 132).

ticiples must here go into verbs in English; ‘il they were ever baltled by
the extent ol our works, and began to despair because moles had been
carried right up to their walls, then they would bring up a number of
vessels and so transport themselves to some neighbouring town.¹ Caesar
ean be well translated only in this way.
