270 DE BELLO GALLIC’O.

arrangement, that a pressure at any given point propagated its straiu to
the whole bridge and brought its whole constructive strength to bear?

15. dhsota materia, ‘with joists laid lengthways ς’ that is, at right
angles to them. See Jules Cesar (vol. a, p. 260).

16. nihilo secius 3 although the frameworlr was strong enough
independently, yet it was further supported by slanting shores below,
which were at oue end made last to the timbers of the bridge aud 'at
the other sunk in the river-bed.

19. aliae supra ; others by way of stockades a little above.

ao. deiciendi operis, ‘ in relation to (that is, ‘sor the purpose ol')
throwing down the work!

21. aarum rerum see 1. 4, a: ‘defensoribus’is the same as ‘de-
fendentibus’3 ‘neu' the same as ‘et ne,' as in a. 21, ‘cohortatus est, ut
memoriam pristinae virtutis retinerent, neu perturbarentur animo?

aa. c. 18. diebus decem, quibus. Literally ‘within ten days
within which,’ that is, ‘from the time when! So Cic. Rosc. Amer. 37,
‘quatriduo quo occisus est,' ‘within four days from the time when he
was slain.' Ter. Andr. r. 1, 77, ‘in paucis diebus quibus haec acta sunt!
See 3. 23, 1.

²3· exercitus traductam observa that, in resuming the history
alter the description os the bridge, the historic present is used.

74. 4. o.19. nuutios dimisisse uti, δια, ‘had sent messengers to
tell them to leave their homes!

6. atque omnes, we should expect ‘ utque! Probably ‘omnes qui
arma ferre posseut' is rather a limitation of the nominative ‘they'
than itsels the nominative.

8. hio . . atque ibi; unusual as expressing the rame place. Prob
ably Caesar’s thought was ‘ibidem'

11. ut Germanis metum inioeret, namely, ‘that he might terrily
the Germansss The anaphora, or repetition, of ‘ut’ helps the idea of
enumeration.

15. pontemque rescidit. Those who consider the battle with the
Tenchteri to have been near Coblentz, naturally fix the locality ior this
passage on the flat ground near Andemach. 1r the battle, on the other
hand, was near the isle os Bommel, a more northward point would suit
this passage better. Caesar’s object being to relieve the Ubii from the
pressure of the Suevi, and also to punish the Sicambri, it would seem
natural that he should cross the Rhine so as just to enter the' Ubian

territory, and then make this his base os operatione against the
Sicambri. Is so, a reference to the map will show that the passage
must have been near Cologne or Bouu. Os these the latter is probably
