27 2 DE BELLO Gannico.

3¹· coactis contractisque, ‘having been collected and mustered'
The reading· constratis,’ ‘declred vessels: would make it appear that the
troops were not embarlred on the ‘onerariae' But it is evident that
they were so embarlred. at the rate of 100 men per rossel. Each of the
eighteen remaining ships would carry twenty-five horsea, the cavalry
would be therefore 450 in number.

76. τ. ab milibus passuum coto. ‘in the port of Ambleteuse‚ where
they had been windbound (naturally) by the same breeze which was
favourable lor Caesar’s transit.

ro. o. 23. tertia vigilis, ‘at midnight: and on the aoth oi August¹‚
B.C. 55. For the full moon occurred (c. ²9) four days asten and all
astronomers are agreed that the moon was full on the night οἱ Aug. 30
(accurately at 3 am. on the 31st). Tidetables show that on that day
it was high water at Boulogne at about 7³5 p.m.‚ sor the tide is sorty-
eight minutos later than the corresponding tide on the previous day:
and it was high water at Boulogne at 11.25 p.m.'0n the grst, the day os
the tull moon. Tben the end os the flood and the beginning of the ebb
were occupied by Caesar-'s fleet in dropping down the harbour; and
the fleet was ready to sail by midnight.

12. hora quarta: he reached the Dover shore at about 8.30 (the
first hour at this seasou ‚was at 5.6), aud then rode at anchor, for his
transports to come up, till about 330. There had been high water at
Dover on that day at 7.36 anm tor it was high tide at Boulogne at 749,

² and Dover tides are thirteen minutes in advance ol those of Boulogne.

21. ut rei militarie ratio, dcc„ ‘as he said, all military praem, es.
pecially that on board ship required! The subjunctive being the quasi-
oblique seems to induce Caesar to put ‘ut' instead of ‘quod' which

. would be more natural.

Ἃ , 24. ventum et ustum mundum The tidal current oti Dover

“· ⁴ turns from east to west iour hours aiter high water¹ and then runs
“ west ior seven hours. Therelore as high water had been at 736 ant.
«Ἴ on that day, the current had turned at 11.36‚ and had to run west, in

Ξ the direction of Romney, till ⁶.36 pm.

, 26. circiter mitia septem. If there is no error in Mr. Lewin’s

calculations (which have been followed throughout the preceding notes),

ς) Caesar now lands at a point about seven Roman miles west of Donet,

that is, at Lymne in· Romney marsh. where the cliffs are iar back from
the beach and there isa fine shingle.
