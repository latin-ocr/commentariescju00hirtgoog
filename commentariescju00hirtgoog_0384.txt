nores. viii. 12-21. 337

for ‘consueverant' the reference must be to some passage of Caesar
unknown to ns (Livy 3 5. It, ‘inermes sedentesque pars maxima specta·
bant* may be thought to throw some light on the subject).

101. 10. o. 16. ne hostis ...concretum ‘lest the enemy should be

i ¹ thinking of making a halt at some point, and enticing our men into

some place of danger!
12. intrare humum, a correction for ‘iugum’ If the latter is right,

'i v ‘intrare ’ would be a kind of Zeugma, like Horace’s ‘terret equos equi·

tumque vultus’ ’

17. loco munitissimo, the Mont Ganelon.

²4· o. 17. quem in locum, the antecedent repeated from an abnost
exoessive wish for clearness: as in 1. 6, ‘duo omnino itinera erant
quibus itineribus domo exire possent?

26. qua consuetudine, according to his custom of sending out horse-
men to cover his foraging parties.

28. interponis auxilia both sides were now trying which could
work best a cavalry organized like that of 'the Germans. See ως 7, 80.

192. 2. e.18. oum rennuerent, as they were willing to accept any
offer of battle from feeling themselves supported by the legions, they

took their ground by squadrons without hesitation.
7. neque plures conveniunt, ‘and did not allow themselves to be

pushed in upon one another.' The ‘plerumque’ belongs to ‘accipitun’
not to ‘accidit,’-hyperbaton.
ro. o. 19. in vinem reri proeliarentur, ‘and had for some time been

charging in single and successive squadrons.'

¹3· diversum proelium, δια, ‘and then a battle of the most perti·
uacious kind began in another direction' Ι

17. turmis interpositi, ‘passing through the intervals of the
squadrons!

19. ut ratio postulabat, as was natiual in such a battle. By
‘imprudentes’ is meant ‘though they bad no notice of the attacks

3²· eum interim, &c., ‘and meanwhile Correus could not be in-
duced to leave the battle or' take refuge in the woods; nor could our
men by their calls to surrender hinder him from wounding many of the
conquerors, and so forcing them in anger to use their javelins against

' him!

19³. 9. o.20. peuots receptis, since only very few'came in from
the rout, and even these were wounded, finding that everything was
against them, they raised a general cry, ‘let ambassadors and hostages
¹ besenttoCaeser.' ·
16. o. 21. evestigio, ‘instantly’ as ‘in vestigio‚' 4. 5.
