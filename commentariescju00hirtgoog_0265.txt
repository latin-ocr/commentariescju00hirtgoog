Rhone as sar as Culoz, and then gone by Amberienx to the Saone at

31. inmeritum metiri, ‘to give the soldiers their monthiy allowanoe

of 5olbs. os corn! ’ “
10, 1. quem vergobretum appellant, ‘the holder oi which office they'
call th'e Guerg·breath’ (strong in judgment). For the character and
limits of this officesee Thierry, bna c. 1. p. 510.

4. tam necessario tempore, ‘at a time os such urgency!

6. multo etiam gravius, ‘with still greater vehemence! The
punctuation in the text, which is that os Kraner and Nipperdey, seems
undoubtedly correct. The common way os expressing the same sense

should be omitted; it looks like a copyist repetition from the end os the .
preceding clause.

quin . . . sint erepturi3 the strong future subjunctive for which
the present subjunctive ‘eripiant' might be substituted in a lighter
style. y

18. necessario.. .ooaotue; some MSS. and editions read ‘neces-
sarium' apparently with the intention 'of avoiding tautology. It appears,
however, simplet to translate ‘when he could not help it, and on ex-
press compulsion! Cp. Bell. Civ. 3. 49, ‘necessario loca sequi demisse
cogebantur‚’ and Ter. Andr. 4. 1. 8, ‘turn coacti necessario se aperiunt!
