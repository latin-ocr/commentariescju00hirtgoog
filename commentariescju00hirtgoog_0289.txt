passing it over3 whence the common meaning, ‘to delay.'

6. loco pro nutris, δια, ‘he chose a plaoe before his camp which
lay near enough and was suitable lor forming a line ol battle; and, asr
the hill on which his camp was placed rose to a small height from the
plain, with just frontage enough lor an army in battle array, and to-
, wards the lront sioped gently back to the level at'ter rising to a slight
eminence‚ while its flanks were slightly precipitous, he carried from each
flank ol the bill a ditch ending in a redoubt.' It is difficult to under-
stand this passage clearly. The excavations seem to prove that one ol
these ditches ran from the south-east angle ol the camp to the Aisne‚ the
other from the north-west angle nearly to the Miette. But this would be
placing them both on the right ol the position ; whereas the text seems

⁸ to indicate that they guarded both flanks; and, taking it alone, we should

certainly think that they were drawn at right angles to the right and left
ol Caesar’s line, and on both sides towards the enemy. Perhaps the
solution may be that the turo ditches given in plate 8 to Jules Cdsan to-
gether constituted the right-hand ditch ol the two mentioned by Caesar
(their combined length would have been about 600 paces) ; and another

similar ditch (effaced or not discovered) may have been drawn at right ¹

angles to the left ol the position, crossing from river to river, in a length
of 600 paces, as the eastern one did. hythe help of the intervening camp.
The word ‘ transversam' seems ol itself to imply that the ditches crossed
