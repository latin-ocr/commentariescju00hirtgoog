quam iis pensi est,' Livy 34. 49.' Observe Caesar’s effective method in
narrating. He states here only that he gave Labienus his'orders: what
these orders were, the sequel brings out in a more telling way than a

ι detailed account oi the orders as given would do.

ro. o. 22. equo admisso, ‘with his horse at iull speedss’

Urs. insignibus Gallicis, the devices on their shields and helmets.
Observe that ‘Gallie’ is equivalent to ‘Helvetian’ here. The inserence ·
which Caesar drew srom Considius’ information was, that Labienus had
been repulsed, perhaps destroyed; and that he must expect an attack at
once.

18. multo die, '⁶ when the day was much: that is, ‘far advanced!

20. quod non vidisset, pro viso, an amount os bewilderment hard
to imagine. Was Caesar always generous in his account oi the pro-

²4· o. 23. postridie eius diei ς ‘posteri’ is the ablative agreeing with
‘die’ (cp. postet, audantes). The pleonasm of ‘ diei' is like ‘perfacile
sactu esse probat conata perficere' in chap. 3:

biduum is an abridgement oi ‘bidivuml When this is reduced to

’ a dissyllabis, the first syllable becomes long by position.

leit a little on the right this city, so celebrated as the druidioal capital
o's Gaul. Its ancient name still remains in the Mont Beuvray, which
appears, by recent excavatious ¹, to have been its site. On the peculiarity
