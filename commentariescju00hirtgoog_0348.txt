4. anno post ulio transire: this is repeated from 4. ι, probably in
order to introduce the list of reasons for the practice.

15. cssss. finitimos cedere, in objectlve propositions‚ Caesar's
preference for the weak accusative and infinitive is marked. Cicero
prefers the strong subjunctive form, ‘proprium est epistolae, ut is ad
quern scribitur, de his rebus, quas ignoret, certior fiat ’ (de Orat. 3. 112).

18. bellum catillatum defendit, &c., ‘when a state is either

125. 1. c. 24. cum Germanos Galli superarent. Caesar con-
cludes that as there are Volcae Tectosages in Bavaria, they must
have sprung from a Gallie colony emigrating eastward. Rather they
were a section of the nation which never 'penetrated so far‘ west as Gaul,

‘ the Theiss.

17. dierum iter sexaginta: the distance would be 600 miles without
,windings enough for two months’ march. For the Duke of Alva’s
celebrated ride, the most rapid transit of these countries on record before
railways, see Motley, Rise of the Dutch Rep.. vol. a, p. 90.

24. ed initium. ‘to the end‚' as we should say. But the ancients
were apt to conceive of a direction as being from the object to themselves.
