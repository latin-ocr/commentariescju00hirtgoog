28. auxilii 01111111, ie. ‘auxiliorum locu,' ⁴ as auxiliaries.’

²9· nostras legiones. Schneider supposes that the pronoun gives a
tinge of surprise to the statement.

4⁵. 2. 0. 25. Ouarar. . ‚seuto.. ¹detracto. . prooessit. To this
main sentence or apodosis a very long introduction or prothesis is
attached. The prothesis may conveniently be divided into two parts, the
first as lar as ‘esse impedimento vidit: the second to ‘submitti posset!

3. signis in unum collatis; causative to ‘esse impedimento,’ the
soldiers were in each other's way, because the standards were so
crowded together. For ⁶ sibi ipsos¹ see 1. 4, note 9.

5. centurionibus cociam similarly this and the four succeeding
ablatives absolute are causal to ‘reliquos esse tardiores ;' ‘As all the
centurions ol the fourth eohort were slain, &c.‚ therefore the rest oi the
men were getting cowed! y

10. nonnullos ab novissimis, 810, ‘while some in the rear were
leaving the battle, drawing aside and avoiding the daris!

13. rem esse in angium vidit; the preceding infinitives seem all
to have depended upon the former ‘vidit' But the extreme length of
the sentence (conveying, as it does, a sorcible idea oi the number and
variety of the difficulties) induces Caesar to repeat the verb here.

17. signa inferre, ‘he ordered them to advance, at the same time
opening out their mules! ’ ’

24. c. 26, conversa signa, dic, ‘he ordered the two legions 10 draw
together. form up into one continuous line, and advance against the
enemy! Cp. 1. 25, note 8.

46. a. nihil...reliqui fecerunt, &c., ‘leit nothing undone in the
way of speed.'

5. 1127. tum calones, bc.. ‘besides which the camp sollnwers even
when unarmed, threw themselves on the armed enemy!

7. pugnant . . . praeferrent. See the last note on 7. 61.

9. in extreme spe salutis: see 1. 33, note 3.

11. his deiectis, ‘when these in their turn were struck down!

16. quae fmilia. bc, ‘all which enterprises their high courage had
made easy to them, though naturally very difficule!

18. e. 28. internecionem there must have been exaggeration in
their accounts as they were able to revolt against the Romans again in
5. 28, and also to send a contingent of 5000 mento Alesia (7. 75)¹.

¹ Probably this indicates that Caesar'r worlr was written piecemeal, and
shortly after the several events occurred. Afterwards he apparently would
not alter the accounts which gave his impression at the time.
