Tongres. The reasons ior this are given at length in Jules Cesar (vol. 2,
p. 201, note) and are in substance that no other place satisfies the
necessary conditions. The two principal objections would be that
Tongres was by no means in the centre oi the Eburonian territory, and
that Caesar makes no mention oi crossing the Mense on this march.
But the ford of Vise was probably well-known even then; so that the
passage of the Mense would not cali for any peculiar notice; aud a
military man would take his idea of a central position more from the
roads than from the general country which he occupies. Thus Tongres
would be a ‘medius locus,’ as lying on the great arterial road oi the
Mense, by which alone the haggage of the army could be transported.
