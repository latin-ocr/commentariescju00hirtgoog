the person to whom it was adjudged by law Cp. Livy 33 13, ro, ‘ut
belli praeda Romanos, urbes captae Aetolos sequerentur: and Hor. Sat.
1.8‚ 13, haeredes monumentum ne sequeretur

ao. ut igni cremaretur, inapposrtron with poenam! Τ11ε ending
in :probably indicates the meaning‘ in the fire.’ So we have⁴in C.
Verris supellectili‚’ and ‘navi processit,' ‘ he went by sea!

21. die constituta oauaaa diationis ; the genitive on genitive is more
frequently used by Caesar than by any other writer. Thus we have
(3. 18) ‘superiorum dierum Sabini cunctatio! The genitives ‘dictionis'
and ‘dierum’ seem to mean ‘belonging to‚’ like ‘fiducia virium,' ‘aditus
laudis: ‘oontentio honorum‚’ and the like.

22. familia, ‘all his dependants :' the word as being connected with
‘famulus' properly means ‘a body os slaves ;' and is opposed to the
‘liberi' who constitute the family, as now understood. For the ‘ob-
aerati’ see 6. 13.

28. suspicio3 the length oi the ἰ probably comes by contractiori ior
‘suspicitio ;' cp. ‘convicia and pervicax!

29. quin ipae eibi mortem oonaoivefit3 the negative ‘quin' is

carried on to the dependent sentence from the negative character ol the ¹

main sentence ‘neque abest suspicio! Cp. the French construction ‘je
ne doutais pas que vous n'eussiez raison!
, consciverit3 the meaning oi ‘conscisco’ is ‘to decree or settle
with onesels' (causum, convenere, conscivit, is a formula in Livy 1. 3),
hence this phrase ior‘ to commit suicide?

ipae eibi, not ‘sibi ipsi! ‘’'Ipse is more elegantly used as asubject
thanasanobject.

31, ο..5 ut e flmbua ania exodun auobyective sentence in appo
sition with ‘id quod ¹constituerant‚’ namely‚ to leave their own territory.
4. 2. nt paratiores essent3 ‘ut’ is used instead oi ‘quo' here. because '
so many words intervene between it and the comparative.

4. mausum, an older sorm of mensium. A comparison oi the words
menstruus. μήν, μείς, makes it probahle that the i was no part os tho

7. una oum iia3 ii secum ’had been used there would have been 1

aeoniusion with the ‘ suis ’ immediately preceding. The words ‘Rauraci’

‘Tulingi' ‘iatuvices' are the subjecta sor the time most prominent, and ι

therefore take the reflexive prououns.
