were tattooed with ‘variae animalium effigies! Can it be that the

34 uxores communes: it is hard of course to refute this outrageous
¹ charge. But inasmuch as the accounts of medem travellers do notstate any-
thing equally vile os the most barbarous tribes now known, it seems rea·
sonable to doubt it. Sir J. Lubbock (Prehistoric Man, p. 388) tells us,
it is true, os a romaniae similar arrangement among the Tahitians. ‘A
considerable number.’ he says, ‘of the principal people were sormed into
an association called the “Arreoy,” all the members of which were
regarded as being married to one another. If any os the women of the
society had a child, it was almost invariably killed; if it was allowed to
live, the father and mother were regarded as having definitively engaged
themselves to one another, and were ejected from the association; the
woman being hencesorth known as a ‘⁸ bearer of children ;” which was
among this extraordinary people a term oi reproach’ This practice,
then, was evidently intended to repress, from natural causes, the birth
oi children. Can it be possible that, it a custom at all like it had been
extensively prevalent in Britain, there would have been in the island the
‘infinita multitudo hominnm* which Caesar describes. See, sor the
arguments on the other side, the Pict. Histoi England(r.19r),and
