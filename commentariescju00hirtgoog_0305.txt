the Gauls is prompt‚’ &a . . . ‘so on the other, hand, their intellect is
too slack and nerveless to bear up well against calamity.'

60. 5. ο. 20. quaa pars ..ax tertia parta, ‘which section of Gaul
is to be considered as a third of the whole country? ‘Ex tertia parte'
means ‘on the footing of a third part‚’ like ‘haeres ex asse,’ ‘a sole
legatee‚' 'ex facili’ ‘easily' As to the exaggerated size of Aquitania,
we may remark that Caesar appears to have thought that the Garonne
has a general course running more to the northward than it really has.
He places Aquitania, in 1. 1, to the north-west of the Roman provinces:
whereas its general position would be better described by saying that it
lies west and south-west of the Provincia. It is true that this descrip-
tion is founded on the direction of the Upper Garonne (see the note
on 1. 1), but this would not sufficiently account for the over estimate.

8, paucis ante annis; hyperbaton; see note to 1. 6, and other ¹

references in the index. y
Praeconinus, Mallium these had been generals sent against Ser·
torius, B.C. 78, and defeated by his lieutenants in Aquitania. ¹

13. Tolosa Narbone et Carcassone is the reading of early editions. 1
The third name is omitted on the ground, first, that copulatives are not ¹
used to couple the second and third member only as in English¹; and ’

secondly‚ that Carcassone became important only in the middle ages.

16. Sontiates; the name (still remaining in the town of Sos) ap-
pears to mean ‘heroes' (See Greek, Keltische Namen‚ p. 155), and is
Celtic not Aquitaniam So the Bituriges of Aquitania were Celts.

ao. ostenderunt, they suddenly unmasked their infantry!

The limiting adverb rs often omitted m Latin, asinl. a Seethe last
note on that chapter.

27. attinere, ‘by simple escalade.'

30. longe peritissimi; superlative absolute, ‘very skilful indeed:
See note1,on 3. 8.

31. aerariae secturae—‘eoppa mines! Some MSS. read ‘struc-
turae' But though the expression ‘subterraneae structurae' occurs in
Pliny (36. υ), ‘secturae' is simplet. The ‘cuniculi’ werefor the pur·
pose of destroying the embankments from beneath. The introduction
of ⁸ et' would not by itself justify tte omission of ⁴ Carcassone τ’ as Caesar
often violates the mle given above, even when the three objects are
strictly coordinate.
