caught sight of our cavalry! Note that if the cavalry had g'one in ad-
vanoe towards an enemy only twelve miles off, before the ambassadors
were dismissed with tidings of the truce, it is possible, to say the least,
that the German cavalry had not heard of the armistice.

4. non amplius octingentos. The numeral is governed by ‘haberent'
as if ‘ non amplins' were omitted. .

9. narsus resistentibus, abl. absolute with subject omitted, as in
Livy 1. 37, ‘additur dolus, missis qni ligna in flumen conficerent?

14. Piso aquitanus. From the similar case of C. Valerius Procillus
(1. 47) we may conclude that this Gallie chief had received a Roman
name along with citizenship: perhaps from the L. Piso mentioned in
.1.12.

15. regnum, ‘royal power,’ as in 1. 3.

16. amicus3 see 1. 33, note 8.

22. c. 13. hoo facto proelio. This skirmish seems to have strongly
confirmed Caesar's impression of the efficiency of the German cavalry.
See iv. 2. His feeling appears to have been originally inspired by
Ariovistus' horsemen (1. 48), whose organization he afterwards imitated
in the battle of Pharsalia ¹. He must have perceived that if the main
body of German cavalry now came up, he would soon find his own
Gauls, if any further quarrel arose, absolutely useless in the field, and a
revolt of the whole country rising in his rear. Thus he resolved to ·
make no enquiry whether the attack was excusable or not; and to con-
sider the truce irrevocably broken.

24. per dolum atque insidias, a prepositional adverb; as ‘per
summum dedecus’ means ⁴ most disgracefully! 'So ‘ex confesso? ‘eon-
fessedly ι’ ‘de integro,' ‘afresh 2’-‘ ad postremum‚' ‘finally'

26. summae dementiae esse iudicabat exspectare: a good reason
for fighting at once; ifthe truce was justly broken. In reciting it,
Caesar appears to betray the thoughts which really influenced him.

31. ne quem diem pugnae, δια, ‘so as not to let a day be missed
for fighting: ‘Pugnae' is genitive, as in the ordinary ‘tempus com-
mittendi pmelii! Both phrases would mean literally, according to the
accurate analysis of the genitive case ‘a time in relation to fighting!

opportunissima res, ‘a most fortunate accident;' ‘enabling him‚'
says Merivale ‘to execute a treachery darker and deeper than their
own! See, however, note 1 to this chapter.

71. a. eontra atque esset dietum, ‘contrary ¹to what they had
