his mode of bridging a large river like the Rhine‚ or passing a
smallerone in the face of the enemy (as he did the Allier in 7. 35),
and above all, perhaps, his way of stimulating his soldierS, and re-
’ pressing discontent or mutiny, as in the well-known scene of 1. 40.
Over and above Caesar’s exploits‚ too, there are many singular
military feats of his lieutenants‚ such as the defence of Qintus
Cicero’s camp against the Eburonians, and the various stratagems
of Labienus. Not the American civil war itself exhibitsa stranger
and more picturesque variety of enterprise, or fumishes more
available hints to the military student than the Bellum Gallicum
of Caesar.

The late work of the Emperor Napoieon 111 οη the military
life 'of Caesar certainly deserves in a ver'y high degree indeed the
gratitude of all students of the Commentaries. lt is true, of
course, that the Imperial writer was possessed of opportunities
and means of research into the topography of the various cam-
paigns such as no man ever had before him. But still, a careful
reader of his second volume will not fail to see that these means
must have been of small avail, if they had not been directed and '
applied by a mind truly perceptive of the points at which re-
search was to be aimed. We would take as an instance of ’

Usipetes is proved to have been near Cleves, and not anywhere
in the neighbourhood of Coblentz; for these rest morcon broad
principles of strategy than on particular local investigation. But
it is when we can see the results of excavation that the full value
of the Imperial research becomes manifest. These include the
discovery of Bibracte and the Gallie roads converging upon it3
the traces of Caesar’s camp on the Aisne, in Book 113 the fullest
possible illustration of the siege of Gergovia, and, above all, the
complete discovery of every relic that ages could possibly leave
of the siege of Alesia. Here we have the trace of all the camps,
the foundations of the redoubts, the drift gravel sent from the
rivers into the Roman ditches, the trous-de·loup made by the
besiegers still as fresh as on the first day, the calthrops and a
' host of other similar antiquities discovered on the spot. Fiually‚
