and point by means of short sentences, as in the closing scenesv
of the siege of Alesia in Book Vll. ln fact, it uses in a somewhat
less developed form than after-writers all the resources of Roman
style; and this with the additional excellence that the expression
never seems to be sought for on its own account, but always
to be the natural outgrowth of the facts narrated. indeed, a
scholar whose taste is formed upon Caesar’s writings does not
find anything afterwards in Roman historical writers which
pleases him so well, Assuming the view that the Latin language
is suited by its inward character to be more than any other the
organ of expression for the true and actual, and that it never
works with such natural ease as when it is stating facts in the
genuine order of their occurrence, one cannot help feeling that
Caesar has more nearly than any other writer been able to
realise this ideal. Whether he turns out on closer examination
to have been perfectly scrupulous or not, it can hardly be denied
thatin proportion as a historical writer is scrupulously candid
and truthful, so will his style approximate to that employed by
Caesar.

Does this excellence then really imply an unusual amount of
candour in the historian, or was it simply the result of his consum-
mate art? This is a point insome degree hard to decide, and
one on which opinions will certainly differ. The view taken in ⁴
the notes to this edition upon this particular point may be briefly
summed up as follows z—Caesar possesses in the fullest degree
the Roman habit of stating everything in a disadvantageous
light for his enemies: thus he makes no mention of the manifold
provocations which the Helvetii received from Roman marand-
ing parties even iu times of peace; nor does he think it necessary
to dwell on the fact that the Romans, in view of the Helvetic
invasion, had made an alliance with Ariovistus, and thus guaran-
teed to him the tranquil possession of his conquesta in Ganl;
in fact, he covers these inconvenient facts by a rhetoric so
shilful that it has constantly passed for simplicity and truth-
fulness. ln the case of the Usipetes and Tenctheri he

‘disguises almost beyond the necessity of the case, the fact
that his only chance of safety lay in attacking the Germans
before their detached cavalry returned. So again in the British⁴
expeditioris, he manages his narration so skilfully that we do not,
