'noran v, 52-56. 291

the words of measurement in the same case a's is ‘amplius' were
omitted.

3¹· a54. oum denuntiaret: see 1.41‚ note 7.

110. 1. imprimis firma, ‘oue ol the strongest in Gaul!

3. adventu Caesaris, th'e words ⁴ discessu’ aud ‘adventu' are often
thus used without a preposition to mark apoint of time. So we have
‘proelio Senensi consul ludos vovit: at the time ol the battle ol Sena.

4. cuiusque maiores: see 5. 25, ‘unte r, and 6. 5, note a. Our
Alghan campaign gives a good hint of the feelings ol those ou whom a
king has been ¹imposed in this way. Such a rulcr moy, nuder very ex-
ceptional circumstances, become acceptable t'o a nation. See Buckle's
History of Civilization, vol. ii. p. 80; Trollope's History os Floreuce‚
vol. i. p. 93; Herod. 4, 161.

8. dioto audientes, ‘obedient ε’ see r. 40, note ιγ.

10. principes inferendi belli; to take the lead iu an attack. So
‘Gallici belli officiis* means service in (in relation to) the late war iu
Gaul. .

15. idque adeo. &c., ‘aud this, indeed. is not, 1 think, to be wondered
at! ‘Adeo ’ is osten used aiter pronouns sor the purpose of emphasizing
them as subjecta. See Virg. Ecl. 4. 11, with Conington's note. Thus
we have ‘ego adeo‚' ‘I for my part‚' like the Greek ἔγωγε. *illum
adeo morem,' ‘that cust0m‚ by the way! Or possibly, as Kraner suggesta,
the ‘adeo' may belong to the ‘mirandum’

17. qui virtute belli omnibus centibus praeferebantur. The ter-
ror which the name os Gaul inspired at Rome has been already noticed
(a. 35, note 4) ; and how roughly the British Celts had handled Caesar
we may judge from the lact that in starting on this campaign Caesar's
two legions which had just returned from Britain, contained together
ouly 7000 men (chap. 49). When, therefore, Dr. Prichard says (Hist. os
Mankind, vol. 3, p. 179) that the Celtic nations were always defeated
when they came into collision with the Germane. and when this lact is
treated as a corroboration os the accounts ol their immorality, we ought
to euquire whether Roman protectorates rather than uatioual customs
did not enieeble the Gauls aud make them incapeble of resiste-nee. Such
is Tacitus’ view. (Agric. 11). See 5. 48, note 8.

18. opinionis: see 2. 24, note 4.

20. c. 55. nullum tempus quin: see 5. 53, note 6.

27. ape lapsus-or 'deiectue' ‘disappoiuted’

33. o. 56. ultro ad se veniri, ‘that a spontaneous movement was
being made in his favour! See 1. 42, note 5.
