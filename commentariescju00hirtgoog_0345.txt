18. nt ipsi iniurias inferrent, in apposition with ‘quod' ·

21. ambactos, a Celtic word, from ‘ambaig,' ‘to lead: or ‘drive
around one' '

²2. hano unam matiam noverunt, ⁴ this is the one only source os
influence with which they are acquainted? See 5. 21, note 4, ior a pre·
dicate implied in a substantive, as it is here in an adjective.

²5. clo. pro victimis, ‘by way of victims! lt will be observed
that no instaures of this kind oi sacrifice are given either by Caesar or·
any other author as occurring in connection with the bnttles of the
period; and considering how earesully Caesar notes such institutions as
that oi the ⁶ soldurii' (3. aa), it may appear that ‘l'hierry (4 r) is right
in considering that these horrors were bygone in Caesar's time. The
Romans themselves, it will be remembered, buried two Gauls olive in
the iorum during the second Punic war, in order to avert an omen (Livy
υ. 57), and that not ior the first time, ns the passage shows.

30. simulacra habeon there is a curious vngueness about this ex·
pression. It would seem to mean that the images were os a kind to be
kept among them, and not, as the general tone would imply, wicker
ceges made ior the occasion, with some resemblance to the shape ol a
man. So in the words ‘quibus succensis’ there is additional obscurity of
conception. The liring oi mere widrerwork would hardly produce a
sufficient flarne; on the other hand, ii the image wns placed on a pile oi
wood, as M. Thierry supposes, wickerwork would not be the most
natural material ior it. This looseness oi expression throws a degree oi
suspicion, ii not on the existence of the custom¹, yet on the fact that it
was current in Caesar's time.

122. 3. descendunt, ‘they have recourse! So we have in 5. 48,
‘redire’ ‘to be reduced: and ‘ deiectis: ‘disappointed’

4. o.1‘l. Mercurium see Tacit. Germ. 9. The general sense
which we get from this passage is that the Gaul’s worshipped gods
whose attributes and cultus were like those oi certain Roman divinities.
Thus Jupiter is probably Taranis, the god of thunder‚ for ‘tamn' is
Celtic for thunder. Mercury is Teutates² (Luw Taith, the god oi

¹ Dr. Prichard quotes from St. F oix (ilist. Essays) the account oia custom
which may have some reference to these ancient sacrifices. ‘There are still

. (1766) some towns in the kingdom,’ the writer says, ‘where the mayor and

sheriff cause to be put into a basket one or two dozen cats and burn thern
in the bonfire of the eve oi St. John! ln case oi a storrn the inhabitants
oia fishing village near Whitby are said to kill their cnts. This seems the
most offhand way possible of giving life for life, retaining in fact the ideo of
these sacrifices, as the French custom did their form.

² Some editions read ‘Mercurii Teutatis¹ ln Livy 26. 44.
