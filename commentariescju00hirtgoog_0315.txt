5. quos . ‚illos retineri iussit. Kraner thinks that the unusual
‘illos' is inserted in opposition to ‘ipsa' ‘he ordered rbem to be detained,
while-he himself. .' More probably the second pronoun is introduced
to mark the succession of events, as after the abl. absolute in 7. 4,
·Vercingetorix convocatis suis clientibus facile (eos) incendit!

10. c.14. omnibus rebus, ‘by the whole state of affairs' ι. 4, note 1.

30. discedendi potestatem fecit. Caesar’s sparing the senate
