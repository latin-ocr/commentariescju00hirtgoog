nonne. IV. 2-4. 263

as Cic. Mil. 13 has ‘adepti estis ne quem metueretis! So we have
‘Video igitur multas esse causas quae illum impellerent: Cic. Rosc.
Amer. 33. In both cases the construction seems to follow the implied
idea ‘connisi estis,' rather than the actual words in which the successful
endeavour is expressed. ‘They have habituated themselves to what
they wanted, namely, the practice of bathing in the coldest water.¹ The
reading of MSS, ‘lavantur,’ seems untenable, for reasons given by
N innerden n· 73·

ὑ. o. 2. magis eo . . quam quo, διο, ‘rather with the view of finding
purchasers for their spoil, thau because they want any imports.' This is
a modification of the more usual phrase, of which Ter. Eun. 1. a, 16, is
a good example, ‘non quo quemquam plus amem, eo feci, sed—.¹ ‘I have
done this, not because Ι love any one better, but because-—.'

8. dealderent, simply ‘desire' as in Plin. Hist. Nat. 17. 26, ‘desi-
derant rigari arbores!

9. impenso pretio, probably literally ‘at a large price3’ not ‘having
expended a large sum! Thus we have ‘impensius damnum‚’ and even
‘cuius cibo iste factus est impensior: ‘by whose food that fellow has
got fatter,' Plaut. Capt. 4. 2, 26.

12. summi laboris: see 1. 39, note π.

13. eodem vestigio, ‘on the same spot'

17. quamvis pauci (sint), ‘however few they may be.' This is the
original meaning of ‘quamvis3' and the subjunctive almost invariably
used after it is thus accounted for.

20. o. 3. publice, ‘in a public way,' that is, ‘to them considered as
states? So the same idea is expressed in 6. 23.

²3· una ex parte a Suebis. Lit. ‘on one side in the directiou of
the Suebi,' that is, ‘on one side of the Suevian domuin!

24. ad alteram partem, as the Ubii were in the neighbourhood of
Cologne, the waste country on the other side of the Chatti (4. r, note 4)
must have been the present Wurternburg, Bavaria, and Baden. Its ex-
tent is here much exaggerated. ¹

25. ut eat . . eaptus Germanorum, so Ter. Adelph. 3. 4, 34, ‘ut
est captus servorum' (id quod capiunt servi).

3²· vectigales, an adjective; ‘vectigal' a substantive.

multo humiliores redegerunt, ‘reduced them to a rnueh lower
condition! A similarly proleptic use of adjectives is found in a. 27,
‘quae facilia ex difficillimis magnitudo animi redegerat'

33. e. 4. iraeadem causa, that i5,‘in eadem re’ So we have‘esse alia
in causa,' ‘to be differently circumstanced: ‘meliore in eausa,’ and the
like. The word ‘ cosa’ has retained the same meaning in Italian.
