24. praeoptarent, &c.‚·‘after pulling'fora long time at the shields
so pinned together, many of them chose to drop their shield and fight
unprotected' (rather than endure such trouble any longer).

26.0n01sor mille passuum, accusative govemed by the‘ distabat·
which' rsimpliedin‘ suberat!

27. copto monte. This hill they occupied; the Montagne du
Chateande la Garde. See the map at p. 7 of the text.

28. qui agmon hostium claudebantz the Tulingi, who had
originally occupied the van of the march, aud therefore were left in the
rear when the Helvetii suddenly turned to follow Caesar. ,

3ο. latore aperto maesii circumvenire, attempted to turn our
right flankl the side on which the men's shields were not.

33. converso signo bipartito intulerunt3 as the Tulingi can
hardly have got quite to the reor ol Caesar's reserves. this must mean
that the third line formed up‘ en potenoe,’ at right angles that rs, to the
main body. Lit. ‘changed their front so as to sace two different ways!
15. a. o 26. ancipiti proelio, &c ‘so the conflict long continued;
maintained very fiercely in both directions!

5. nam hoo toto proelio, dcc, ‘they fell back in order’ (se contu-
lerunt); ‘sor (nam) in all this battle no one saw the back os an enemy.'

9. et e loco stipor-iore. &c‚ ‘and thus from a vantoge ground threw

lrom medrydd, ‘to aim at a mark.’)

16. in fines Lingonum they fled (by Ionnes and nvalon) to
Tonnerre on the edge of the Plateau of Langres.

ao. qui si, i.e. ‘uam si ii juvissent! Eodem loco, that is ‘hostium
loco.’ Dr. Kennedy has well pointed out that the dative of the purpose
cannot be used when the substantive implies a person. Accordingly the
phrase ‘hostis loco habere’ supplies the place os ‘ hosti habere‚' which
is not latin.

24. o. 27. oum eum convenissent. ‘Convenio ' with the accusative
means ‘to meet or call npon,’ as in Cic. de Sen. 10. ‘nemo adhuc cou—
venire me voluit cui luerim occupatus!

qui . ..eos...pnruerunt; the first os these words relates to the
ambassadors, the two last to the main body, by a rather loose construc-
tion.
