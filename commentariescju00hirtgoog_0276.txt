18. 'redditurum non esee, &c'., ‘on the one hand he would not re·
store the hostageS‚ and on the other would not attack the Aedui ι’ see
8. 1, note 2.

21. longe iis stater-num nomen . . afuturum, ‘that their' title of
brothers ol the Roman people should be too far off to avail them! So
Virg. Aen. 12. 52,

‘Longe illi dea mater erit!

24. eum vellet, congrederetur, as ‘congrediatur’ is the direct im-
perative, it follows that ‘congrederetur' is the depressed imperative in
the oblique sentence. ,

quid virtute possent, ‘what the Germanswere worth in the way

5. ed Ariovistum, ‘upon Ariovistus ;' i. e. directly against him.

o. 38. triduit see chap. 23, note 2. ’

10. omnium remim3 see chap. 4, note 1.

1². sio muniebatur, ἀεὶ, ‘was so naturally strong by the character
of the ground it occupied ι’ see 3. 24, note 5.
