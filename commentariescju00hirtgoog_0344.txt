Nonas. vr. 11-15. 297

17. Divitiacum see 1. 19, note 3.

23. reliqua rebus, ‘by all other means’

25. quos quod adaequare intellegebatur, ‘and as it was under·
stood that they matched the Aedui in influence with Caesar? Itis
unusual (except in the perfect tense) to have this impersonal construction
with ‘intelligon’ Caesar apparently wishes to avoid the sound of ⁶ qui ¹
with ‘ii’ following and referring to a different subJect.

32. ο.13. aliquo numero‚‘in any consideration! See 5. 5,note 2.

33. plebes, ‘the (rural) population’

120. 1. nullo consilio. This must apparently be dative (like‘ al·
terae’ in 5. 27), as Caesar uses with ‘adhibeo’ only the regular con-
structions. It should be remarked that ‘alterius' ‘nullius ⁸ are the older
forms: and if Caesar wrote the above words he must have been touched
with the mania for making language uniform which made Cato the
censor use such words as ⁶ sacrem. isti modi‚' anderen ‘ fitur, fiebantur!

7. ’πθϋείοιιοι all omens and the like.

11. ai caedes facta. The Druids in Caesar's time had manifestly
nothing to do with the political government of states; but it is quite

sanctioris only. The instance of Samuel is obvious.

14. sacrificiis interdicunt, this excommunication Caesar sometimes
uses for his own purposes by getting a rebel banned.

21. aut si qui, &c.,‘the most dignified of the rest, if any such there be’

24. in finibus Carnutum, probably where the town of Dreux now
stands.

²9· diligentium see 1. 40, note 6.

121. 5. oum utantur} see 5. 26, note a.

7. quod neque velint, quasi-oblique, ‘because it is supposed that
they do not wish'

11. aninias ab aliis transire ad alios. One of the noblest pas·
sages in Lucan (1. 450) is arr expansion of this sentence. A fine trans-
lation of it is quoted in Pict. Hist. of England‚ vol. ι, p. 61.

13. multa . . disputant, ‘they also theorise largely.’

14. mundi ac terrarum, ‘of the universe and the globe’ The
process by which ‘mundus' carne to have this meaning is curious.
Originally it signified an order or outfit; thus ‘mundus muliebris' stands
for a lady's toilet requisites in the discussions on the Oppian law (Livy
34. 7), and ‘habere in mundo’ means ‘to have in stock‘ in old writers.
It therefore comes to mean the ordered universe justas κόσμοι does in
Greek.

i. 16. o. 15. est equitnm understand ‘genus’
