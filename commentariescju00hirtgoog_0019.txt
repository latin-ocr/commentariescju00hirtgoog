raged most fiercely, the French officers employed have found ’

vast numbers of arrow-heads, and even the coins which fell in
quantities from the slain on that terrible day. Nor should the Ι
1 curious discovery at Uxellodunum be left unmentioned, where
the very face of the ground, which had been covered by a landslip,

hasbeen regained by judiciously removing the soil piled over it3
and thus Caesar’s siege works have been revealed to view, almost =
as if they had been preserved inamuseunn It must thereforebe ,ι
obvious that in these cases a contribution of immense importance ’

hasbeen made towards the understanding of these campaigns;

and our gratitude for this is proportionate to the difficulty which Ἴ

existed before in making them out with any cleamess. The
admirable atlas which accompanies the work also contributes
largely to make the reading of Caesar delightful.

As to the point of Caesar’s‘landing-place in Britain, Mr.
Lewin's calculations have been followed in preference to those¹ of l
· the author of Jules Cesar, which appear to rest in part upona

mistranslation slight in itself, but important in its consequenees.

The subject is still so far from being clear of difficulty, that y
any judgment upon it must be considered in some degree ἶ

provisional.

The text given is mainly that of Kraner aud Nipperdey; γ

exceptions are noticed in their place. The notes of the former of

these editors, as also those of Mr. Long, differ somewhat in plan ᾗ

from those of this volume; but valuable references have been

made in the course of it to both these editions. lt may perhaps κ

be allowable to suggest that a learner should always in using the

present work study the early books first, as the explanations of

both words and things which are referred to afterwards are
naturally given in full in these books
