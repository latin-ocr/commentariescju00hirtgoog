INTRODUCTION.

Causnn’s Commentaries have been universally acknowledged
to be the best of manuals both of Latin style and oi the mili-
tary art. As to the former point, they have all the consummate
cleamess which belongs to genius thoroughly informed as to the
facts which it is relating. Compare with them Sallust's account
of the Jugurthine war, and one becomes instantly aware of the
difference between a fancy account of a campaign, such as a
rhetorician can work out from secondhand information, and one
which never, even in its most rhetorical passages, fails to maintain
the tone of real, unmistakeable fact. The mode of narration in
the Commentaries is so earnest, serious, and straightforward,¹
the logic of events is so closely knit, the words have so strong
an appearance of being selected with a view to expressing the
simplest truths in the simplest way, that it is only by an effort
that we can bring ourselves to criticise the statements which
they contain, and examine how far they represent reality. We are
never put on our guard, as we often are in reading Livy, Cicero,
or Tacitus, by passages whose very eloquence makes us at once
suspect concealment of fact. Nothing seems introduced for the
sake oi antithesis3 np colouring, or hardly any, is ever added
for the purpose of giving an adventitious interest to the scene;
yet a natural euphony and grace pervades the whole. The style
easily and naturally sympathises with the most various circum-
stances of the history: it is forcibly rhetorical in Book l, where
the right of the Roman people as against the Helvetii or Ariovistus,
as viewed by Caesar, has to be put in the strongest light possible ;
indeed, in alight stronger than the truth allows. lt can collect
itself into long and involved periods, where an accumulation of
danger and difficulty has to be described, as in the Nervian battle
in Book ll. lt can summarise rapid events with singular force
