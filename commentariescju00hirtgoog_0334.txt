noran v. 34-40. 287

13. c. 87. iubet 3 the imperfect ,changes tc the histon'c present after
the beginning of the sentence. So, frequently.

20. se in castra recipiunt, ‘tried to make their way back‚’ as the
following sentence shows. ‘Illi’ means ‘those who succeeded in getting
there!

’ 25. ee ipsi interficiunt. Compare Lucan's striking description of
asimilar scene at sea (Phars. 4. 520). We learn from Suetonius (Vita
Jul. Caes. 67), that on hearing cf this disaster Caesar vowed to let his
beard and hair grow till he had taken vengeance on the Eburones; but
the end of chap. 52 throws some doubt on the truth of this story.

33. ο.38. Ner-vion it has been already remarked (2. 28, note) that
the destruction cf the Nervii as described in that chapter must be exag-
gerated. Here we find them withan independent force of their own;
and also retaining the command of a confederacy. Sc in 7. 75, they send
5‚000 men tc Alesia. See, however, the foomote to a. 28.

102. 7. c.89. Ceutrones, δια, the exact positions of all these nations
are unknown. For the camp of Cicero, see the map at 42 1.

17. aegre is dies sustentatur, ‘the day was got through with ditii-
culty3' in π. 6, the phrase is ‘aegre ec die sustentatum est 3' see the note
there.

²3· o.40. turres admodum centum et viginti, δια, ‘about 120
towers are raised! If we estimate the circumferenoe cf the camp of
a legion at 4,6oc feet, then rac towers would given distance of about
40 feet from tower to tower. Every ppint of the cumin between the
towers would thus be well within the reach cf missiles from towers on
each side cf it, and therefore there would be no, need to expcse the men
on the wall. They were open at the sides and behind, sclidly timbered
towards the enemy, and their object was. like that of modern basticns,
to shorten the length of wall to be occupied by the defence. See plate
27 tc vol. 2 of Jules cesar. The difficulty of the defence on the preceding
day from the simple banquette must have been extreme.

31. praeustae sudem the stores of regular missiles must have been
soon expended in such a continued conflict.

muralium pilorum, large javelins like the ‘falarica' described in
Livy 21. 8.

32· contabulantur, ‘were completely lined with planks! Such light
work as this must have been could hardly have supported more than
one story.
