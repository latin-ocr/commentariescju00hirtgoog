260 nn· nunno nazareo.

men are ‘impediti’ by the difficulty of crossing a river (1, 12), by the
confusion of a rout (3. 19), by overcrowding in the ranks (a. 25), &c

10. sub earomie infirmiore animo, (und. futuri essent).‘and when
they would be dispin'ted from being heavily ladem·

12. productis Romanorum copiis, ‘although the Romans fonned
their line for battle,' concessive abl. absolute.

13. opinione timor-im see 3. 17, note 7. Here the meaning is ‘from
the idea which they bad given our men of their cowardioe.’ This, how-
ever, is an emendation for ‘atque opinione timidiores hostes' which the
MSS. read. If the old reading is retained, the meaning must be ‘and
from their having shown themselves more timid than their reputation’

16. omnibus cupientibus, ‘and finding thern all ardent! So we have
the dative ‘cupientibus signum dat‚' as he found them anxious for battle
he gave the signal. A similar ellipse of the ⁰ verbum sentiendi: is found iu
the form ‘quum iarn non possent: ‘as they found themselves now unable!

aa. e. 25. opinionem pugnantium, ‘an impression as if they were
combatants.' See 2. ²4· note 4.

23.ex1000 superiore mieea; causative. The participle might be

same accuracy ;' see 1. 58, note 3. drugonem see 1. 40, note 6.

on our side‚¹ ‘ab hoste stare,' ‘to side with the enemy! The gate named
is the one to the rear of the camp. On the derivatiou of the term, see
Dict. Antiq. omrai, ξ 6, and Donaldson’s Varronianus, p. 270.

28. aad. quid fieri velit, ostendit: see 1. annotet.

30. intritae, a participle negatived, like ‘illaesus’

33. priua quam videri posset. lt is well to remark a frequent dif-
ference between the indicative and conjunctive with ‘antequam’ or
‘priusquam’ Iu 1. 53, Caesar says, ‘neque prius fugere destiterunt,
quarn ad fiumen Rhenum pervenerunt? Here the indicative throws a
narrative stress on ‘pervenerunt' making it mean ‘until they reached the
Rhine, as in fact they did reach it.' But ‘priusquam videri posset’
means before they could see, without implying thar they ever saw. So
Sall. Jug. 54 (fin.) ‘priusquam ex castris subveniretur, in proximos colles
discedunt: where the help was, in point of fact, not brought. See also
Kritz, Sall. Catil. 4. ad fin.

63. 1. plane videri. Caesar appears to use ‘plane’ in the simple
sense, ‘plainly’
