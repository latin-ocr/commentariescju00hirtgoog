'norea r. 14-18. 281

91. 6. o. 15. ut fuerim see 3. 15, note 3.

9. intermisso spatio, ‘after an interval of time;’ as in Hor. Od.
1.11,6. .

14. his primis legionum these, as such, contained the best soldiers.

16. per medios perruperint, ‘they dashed at the interval;’ prob·
ably sweeping away the flank companies of each cohort. These are
thought to have been in Caesar’s time fuller than the other cohorts, and
at a later period were called ‘cohortes milliariae,’ and had a double
number of men. Their dignity consisted also partly in having the
custody os the eagle. Dict. Antiq. p. 500 a.

17. receperunt . . repelluntur. It looks as is these gallant fellows
swept back through the interval widened by their former attack, and
even again charged until repelled by fresh cohorts.

η. o.16. dispari proelio; see 4. 33, note 1, and 4. 13, note 1.

28. equestris proelii ratio; the 'conduct os a battle if cavalry alone
were used.

30. rari, so as to disquiet the whole os the Roman line.

31. stationes dispositas haberant, ‘and also echeloned their
chariots,' so as to attack in successive squadrons.

92. a. o. 17. tres legiones, an unparalleled number sora foraging
party. They went out probably towards Chilham.

4. sicuti ab legionibus non absisterent, sent off the soragers,
Ι yet did not cease assaulting the legions.

6. nequo finem sequendi fecerunt. After repelling the enemy’s
charge, the legion advanced steadily in pursuit; until at length the
cavalry, finding that they would be supported, dasbed sorward in ad-
vance and drove the ¹enemy before them.

11. auxilio: the various contingents of British troops left Cassivel-
launus’ army. Quintus Cicero appears to have written about this time
to his brother in a tone of qualitied confidence; for the orator answers
‘cognovi nihil esse nec quod metuamus, nec quod gaudeamus* (Ad
Q. Fr. 3. ι).

15. o. 18. uno omnino 10003 Conway, Sunbury, Petersham, King·
stou, Wallinglord, and even Westminster, claim the honour of Caesar's
transit. The evidence is null sor any one of them. All we can say is,
that the passage was probably above Teddington, where the river ceases

' physical degradation. The ‘multitudo hominum' gainsays the one expecta-
' tion, and a slight but graphio touch of British character (now as then) in

Tacit. Agr. 13, init. seems inconsistent with the other, '‘Domiti ut pareant,
nondum ut serviant,’ &c
