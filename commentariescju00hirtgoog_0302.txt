cette bete de mot?

no. pro loci natura, ‘considering the character of the scene of
action.¹

25. ventus coepisset et se vento dedissent. Cp. 1. 8, note 3,
(⁶ei¹ ior ‘vento’ would have been inelegant; especially es ‘vento se
dare’ is a well-known phrase.) ·

28. quarum renum.. cesus, ‘whereas our ships had to sear all these
contingent pen'ls?

that he must wait for his fleet'

Auray as soon as the approach of the Romans from the Loire was
signalled to thern. The battle took place in the bay of Quiberon, and

superiority oi the Breton fleet in number and equipment‚ this victory ol
the Romans is a real master-stroke.

the several vessels!

5. quem rationem pugnae insisterent, ‘what plan of fighting

they were cast was so much lower3 (for this prepositional abl. absolute,
see ι. 33, note 3), and, on the other, those sent by the Gauls fell more
beavily. Considering the weight os a Roman jandin, it is evident that
it must have made the greatest possible difference whether gravity acted
lor or against it.

9. une eret magno usui τοις Caesar really means to say that
without these hooks the battle would not have been won (cp. 7. 41):
but the Romen military instinct avoids even the remotest suggestion ol
possible defeat.

wall. ,
