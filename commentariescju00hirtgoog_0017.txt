and from the fact that so many of the circumstances mentioned

= by him retrace themselves in our lndian empire. .

ln the next place, it may be truly said that, as a military
manual, the Commentaries are almost unrivalled in the variety of
service which they describe. Caesar conducts in the course of
them almost every conceivable military operation. He defeats‚
in Book 1, a vast national immigration, that of the Helvetii3 and
then the German invader Ariovistus, whose very name is an object
of superstitious terror to his soldiers. Next‚ the vast confederacy
of the Belgae assails him. As long as their various nations remain

’ in one combined force, he keeps them at arm's length by simple

works fortifying a well-chosen position on the Aisne; and then,

when they recoil before the difficulty (as the Duke of Brunswick ,

did on nearly the same ground in 1792), he forces them nation by
nation to yield to his arms. This is done by sheer rapidity of
movement, such as to force several of the single nations to
surrender without a blow. ln Book lll he performs the almost
unparalleled exploit of defeating the Breton lieet, in spite of its
. unbounded naval superiority. ln the next book, he overthrows
a second German immigration as formidable as that of Ariovistus,
and adjoums for centuries the day when the Germans are to
burst the barrier of the Rhine. Here is the culminating point of
his fortune3 for the failure in Britain involves him in unceasing
troubles and difficulties up ,to the end of his history. But his
powerful genius carries him through all. He makes head with
decisive vigour against the final and desperate revolt of the entire
country of Gaul. Legions are cut off to the last man; he has
toraise the siege oi Gergovia, on the capture oi which all seems
to depend. But the Gauls can obtain no real advantage3 a series
of decisive strokes enables him at length to coop up all his enemies
in the single town of Alesia, and then by a double system of siege
workS, such as the world had never seen till then, he repels at the
same time all sallies from the town, and all attacks from a most
powerful relieving army and ultimately forces the cit'y to sur-
render. These main operations are also relieved and diver·
