*noros 1. 32-34. · 227

28. aad. ueniundum aa, aie, ‘besides these considerations many
others induced him! ‘Secundus’appears to be another'form oi ‘sequens’

the sense οῖ’ ‘oriens;’ and a similar formation probably lrom the future

’ in ‘moribundus' ‘gemebundus' &c

30. iratres saepenumero appellatos: see Merivale, Hist. Rom.
vol. 1. p. 133, and above, chap. 11, note 1.

33. in tanto imperio, ‘while the empire ol the Roman people was so
great ;’ the prepositional ablative absolute used, as the verb ‘ sum' has no
participle. So Sallust uses the two phrases ‘perditis rebus: and ‘in
extremis rebus,' with the same meaning. So also we have in Cic. off. a,
‘uti in re non dubia testibus non necessariis,' witnesses being unnecessary
when the case was so certain: and Livy 31. 36, ‘ex tarn propinquis sta·
tivis parum tuta frumentatio erat,' as the camps were so near one
another, foraging was unsase. ¹

20. 5. homines ieros ao barbaros, as in chap. 2, note 6.

9. Rhodanus divideret, ‘only the Rhone divided,' asin chap. 2,
note 9.

quibus rebus, which danger should, he thought, be met as soon
as possible. =

11. arrogantiam sumpserat. Caesar here sums up with admirable
brevity all the grounds which induced him to go to war with Ariovistus.
To complete the view os the status, some other facts however, must be
taken into account. The Sequani had originally attached the Aedui
(and called in Ariovistus to their help), because oi the tyranny exercised
by them in laying excessive tolls on the dried meat trade of the Saone
mentioned above. Shortly alter this battle, in ΒΩ. 61, the Roman

, senate, in order to guard against the expected Helvetian invasion, had ,

sent messengers to the chief Gallie cities to induce thern to oppose the
invasion; and in pursuance of this object had passed the decree ior the

= protection ol the Aedui and other allled states, to which Caesar resers in

chap. 35, a step which, taken so late as it was, showed but little ‘lra-
ternal' affection (Cic ad Att. 1.18). At the same moment, and with
the same object, they sent confidential messengers to Ariovistus, saluting
him as ‘rex et populi Romani amicus,’ recognising thus his claims on
Gaul, and according to Plutarch, inviting him to Rome (Vita Caes. 19).
In this manner they persuaded him not to favour the Helvetian invasion ς
but their duplicity in allying themselves with oppressed and oppressor
at once led to its natural consequences in the war now to be
narrated.
13. c. 34. locum medium utriusque, ‘some neutral spot’
