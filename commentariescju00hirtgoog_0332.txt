26. o. 31. comprehendunt utrumque, a graphic scene of disorder,
in which the conduct of Sabinus is sorcibly contrasted with that of
Cicero and Labienus further on in the book. This unmeasured rating
oi those who had died in his service does not say much for Caesar's
probable popularity among his officers. Appendix Ι). to Jules Cesar,
vol. a, shows how many of his early ⁴ legati’ deserted him. Especially
astonishing' rs the bitter enmity of labienus (Bell civ. 3. 19, 71).

6. non ab hoste Ambiorige consilium datum, that Ambiorix
who had given the advice was not an enemy, but their very near and
dear friend. In Greek the concealed predicate would be indicated by
the article following, du δῆθεν οὐκ ὑπ’ ἐχθροῦ τοῦ Κλέωνος παραινουμένων
τούτων. For want of the article this construction is less frequent in
Latin. Horace is very partial to it: thus he writes, ‘ non ingrata feres
pueris munuscula parvis;' ‘They’ll make a nice little present for you to
carry to your little ones! ‘Curres hydropicus‚' ‘you’ll catch a dropsy
and be quick enough then!

leading an army up hill.

16. o. 33. qui nihil providisset. If this were simply an expla-
nation it would be expressed by the indicative ‘providerat' The sub-
junctive implies ‘as of course, he had used no foresight.’ Cp. Cic. Tusa.
3. 12, ‘Tarquinio quid impudentius, qui bellum gereret cum iis.qui eius
non tulerant superbiam’ where the subj. implies ‘as all the world knows!
