pronouns The reflexives (referring to Ariovistus) are ‘ipse' in the
nominative and dative, ‘se' and ‘sese' in the accusative; the deter-
minatives referring to Caesar are ‘ille‚’ ‘illum' ‘eum’ The last ‘illum'
might be elegantly omitted, as it is in some editions.

17. si quid ille se velit, ‘if Caesar wanted him for any purpose’
(in reference to anything). Mr. long quotes the similar phrases ‘paucis
te volo‚' and ‘numquid aliud me visi'

19. sine magno commeatu atque molimento, ‘without a large
commissariat and much trouble besides!

21. in sua Gallia‚·‘ in his part of Gaul.¹

9. e. 36. ius esse belli ut qui vicissent, the perfect ‘respondit'ae
depresses the perfect ‘vicerint ’ into a pluperfect. Similarly the present is-
often depressed into an imperfect subjunctive 3 as in c. 40, ‘ex quo judicari
posse quantum haberet in se boni constantia,' arid Cic. de Sen. 78,
‘Audiebam Pythagoram . ‚nunquam dubitasse quum ex universa divina
mente delibatos animos haberemus! The same depressions were, until
recently, used in English. Thns in the Spectator (No. 325), ⁴ He had
lately read a book in which it was said that the ladies of Chili always
dressed their heads over a basin of water ς’ and Shakspeare, Hen. IV.
