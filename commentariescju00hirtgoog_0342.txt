25. paulum supra eum locum, not probably much higher than
Bonn. Is it had been, Caesar would have lost command ot the military
road from Cologne to Tongres, and there seems to have been no road
from Coblenz to Tongres. His march on the other side os the Rhine
must therefore have been up the Sieg, along the line of the present
Cologne and Siegen railway. It should be remarked that the indueement
to place this passage of the Rhine near Coblenz is the assumption that
the Treveri did not come down so low as Bonn. But there is nothing
to fix their north boundary; that it was the Ahr is a mere hypothesis,
and hiring the passage at Coblenz would imply some unintelligible
countennarching.

εὑ. note atque instituta ration03 since the plan and details os
