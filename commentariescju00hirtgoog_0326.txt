them forget their civil broils, aud for the time this great man was ac·
cepted as general even by his bitterest enemieS, the Trinobantes.

20. a mari milia passuum LXXX„ that is, eighty miles from the
seaatRomney.

25. c. 12. Britanniae pars interior. Caesar's object in writing
these details about Britainis indicated by the curiosity which enlightened
men at Rome felt about the island. Thus Cicero wn'tes to his brother
Quintus, who commanded one of Caesar's legions. ‘modo mihi date
Britanniam quam pingam coloribus tuis penicillo meo. . . . Quos tu situs,
quas naturas rerum et locorum, quos mores, quas gentes, quas pugnas
habes’ (Ad Quint. 2. 15, 16). Compare sor the similar curiosity about
America at the time os its discovery, Prescott, Ferd. and isabella, vol. a.
p. 106.

natos in insula, rather the earliest Celtic immigrants; sor there
are in Britain no antiquities, linguistic or other, belonging to any his·
toric period which take us back sarther than the Celts, or give us any
idea ol a more truly aboriginal nation.

27. ox Belgio. The identioal names alluded to by Caesar are the
Atrebates, Belgae (and Parisii). See Latham, Ethn. ol the British
Islands, p. 70. There were no Cautii, Trinobantes, nor Regni in Gaul:
but the names of towns on the two sides of the channel are so similar,
that Caesar is probably accurate in stating that the origin of these tribes
was Belgian. ·

30. hominum, ‘of the populations

90. 1. plumbum album, ⁶ tiu.¹ It seems obvious that Caesar must
have meant the tin mines to be on the coast, the iron works in the
central districts.

a. aere importat03 probably from the ancient copper mines in
Dalecarlia. Those in England were not worked with any spirit till the.
eighteenth century.

4. leporem, gallinam, anserem. The hare, as is well known, was
forbidden by the Mosaic law ; nor is there any mention in the Bible os
chickens and geese as articles os sood. Hare appears to have been con·
sidered unhealthy in various ways: geese and chickens probably required
more corn-feeding than they would get in Britain to make them palatable.

5. animi οπως so Penelope in Od. 19. 537 says of her gaesa nui
τε σφιν ἰαίνομαι εἰσοροῶσα.

7. remissioribus frigoribus, ‘since the cold is more intenupted.'

η. o.18. vergit ad Hispaniam, ‘looks out towards Spain: Tacit.
(Agric. 34) actually says that Ireiand is between Britain and Spain.

14· pari atqua, like ‘eodem atque!
