without an exertion oi mind, realise, as his own contemporaries
, did, the thoroughness oi his double failure there. Moreover, the
notes on Bookaill make it probable that he has mostseandalously
libelled pur gallant ancestors, and made writer after writer in
England believe that they were mere vicious barbariam, instead
of being a warlilre and disciplined race, at le'ast equal in advance-
ment to the Seihhs oi our own day. Besides this he seems hardly

to have notieed the great accession of ferocity on the Roman .

side in the Gallie wars which followed the British failures; and
though his stating eandidly the facts which shew this, such as
the uurepented massacre at Avaricum, and the starving of the
unarmed multitudes at Alesia, may be considered as marking
his good saith, yet his want of moral sense on such points makes
us suspect that he may, oftener than lie admits, have been guilty
oi such eruelties as Hirtius casually describes in Vlll. 44, as
inflicted on the gallant defenders oi Uxellodunum, whose right
hands were all eut off by Caesar’s order. So again when we
know what is often the conduct towards their subjects of pro-
tected kings in India, we feel that a conqueror like Caesar, who
imposed upon the Gallie republies the yolre oi monarchic families,
whom they detested (the Shah Soojahs of the period), and had
long ago deposed, might, ii he would, have written many a sad
chapter on the means by which, under his auspices, these protected
sovereigns maintained their illegal authority. Lastly, when we
see that no hint is given in the history oi the iate reserved for
the gallaut Vemingetorix on theday of Caesar's triumph, years

r aiter the surrender of Alesia, we feel an apprehension that the

great conqueror's daily life in Gaul would have supplied many
exceptione to the ‘elementia' oi which he so often spealrs as

Ἴ marking his own conduct. Probably therefore it is not too much
³ to say that the suppression of unwelcome truth is a feature not

to be ignored by any one who reads the Bellum Gallicum critically,
especially when it is ohserved how the same reserve seems per-
petually to affect the minuter points oi narratives which are on

the whole truthiul. But with these abatementS, for which ⁸

allowance may easily be made, how much is to be said for Caesar's -
narrative! In the iirst place, it photographs for usa nation com-
pounded of the most diverse tribes, whose habits too have a
ἵ peculiar interest to ourselves, both from our half Celtic blood,
