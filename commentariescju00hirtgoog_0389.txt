14. diversis in locis3 see 8. 31, note 1.

16. manare praecidit. In 7. 4, Caesar blames similar conduct in
Vercingetorix (though the Gaul's excuse was better). We cannot help

subdued it by means of M. Crassus.’ Hirtius affeets the use of asyndeton,

those military colonies of old foundation, like Parma and Mutina, which
