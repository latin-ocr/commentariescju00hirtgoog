’Ἴ NOTES. 1. 17-ss19'.¹ 219

particular, orexact person meant! Cp. Cic. Art. 3. 21, ‘triginta dies
erant ipsi, cum has dabam literas? · .
27. summa audaoia; the appellative ‘ virum’ omitted, as in Livyaa.60,

- ‘Tum Tit. Manlius Torquatus, priscae et nimis durae severitatis ita

locutusfertur.’ ,

30. hoeri. The root of this verb seems to be the same as that of the
verb ‘linquo' l(Curtius Griech Etym. vol. a. p. 50.) Hence we have,
first, the middle or deponent form ‘liceou’ ‘to get a thing left to
oneself' and thenoe ‘to bid for it,’ and secondly, the intransitive form
‘licea’ meaning ‘to be left (that is, sold) at a given price! On the
revenues fanned by Dumnorix, see Mr. Long's interesting note.

35. numerum equitatus: so ‘uumerus pecudum: or ‘impedimento-
rum,' the numbering of cavalry, baggageanimals, or cattle, being a
familiar idea; but ‘multitudo hominum, populorum, telomm: and the
like.

11. 6. favere et cupere Helvetiis. The full phrase would be ‘cupere
omnia Helvetiorum causa,’ or ‘cupere omnia quae Helvetii,’ like Hor.
Sat. 1. 9, 5, ‘cupio omnia quae vis? '

7. suo nomine, lit. 'on an entry of his own,' that is, ‘on his own
account! Ι

8. potentia aius. In chap. 5, note 5 we have seen 'curn iis’ used
for ‘secuml in order to prevent confusion as to the subject referred to.
Here the object of writing‘eius’ instead of ‘ sua,' seems to have been
to express distinctly that the power of Dumnorix had been really ·
diminished: ‘potentia sua’ might have meant only that he said it had ·
been diminished. ’

10. siquid aecidat Romanis: litotes, a gentle way ofsaying anything
ill-omened; like ‘animadvertere' ‘to punish,’ el τι πάθοιεν, ‘if they were
slain ς’ εἰ δ” ἀντέχοιεν ol ἐχθροί, ‘if the enemy got the better' tiit. held
out). ’ ’

11. imperio populi Romani, ‘as long as the empire of the Romans Ι =

lasted ;' ablative of circumstance, like ‘ leni fuit Austro captus,' Hor. Sat.
a. 8, 73 ‘quid hoc populo obtineri potestl' Cic. de leg. 3. 16.

13. in quaerendo, ‘in the course of his enquiries.¹

quod proelium equestre advorsum is equivalent to ‘quae fuga
equitum,’ whence the following construction, ‘initium eius fugae!

19. o. 19. quodtraduxissat, ‘namely that he had given a passage.’
The subjunctive implies that the fact is well known and not new to the
reader. Where this is not the case we have ‘quod cognoverat’a few
lines down.

aa. qnod accusaretur, ‘an offence of which he was accused.’ '
