the neck os the loop is in the same way occupied by castles. The
name ‘Dubis’ means the black river, ‘Alduasdubis' the river ol
black rocks.

16. mons continet, δια, ‘a hill of great height fills up the spaoe
between! Observe the unusually rapid succession of different nomina-
tives here, ‘facultas' ‘id,' ‘flumem' ‘mons' ‘radices’ ‘murus' The style
here makes us think of a general's memorandum book. Compare
with it the sustained sequence os sentences in chapters 14 and 40, which
mark the orator.

²3· c. 89. vocibus, the random conversation of the Gauls and of the
traders (those who came to supply the camp).

24. incredibili virtute. The ablative is used to state details of
character, and therefore where. as in this place, many qualities are
enumerated. On the other hand, the genitive of quality expresses a lead-
ing quality or summary os character, as in 4. 2, ‘jumenta. . summi ut sint
laboris efficiunt? Cicero uses both cases in Ep. Quint. Frat. a. 11,
‘Lucretii poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt: non multis luminibus ingenii,
multae tamen artis :’ see Madvig's Lat. Gr. p. 252·

²⁵· saepenumero, like in ‘ hic loci,’ ‘tum temporis* ‘ubi gentium:
‘dulcissime rerum! In all these cases the Latin language adds to the
adverb the general idea ol space, time, number, dcc, under which it
comes. So in English we have ‘ostentimes‚· 'manifold,' &c

30. amicitiae causa Gaesarem aeoutlr the kind of persons to whom
Freden'ck the Great objected so strongly (Macaulay’s Essays, p. 280).
Probably Caesar was too deep in debt when he began campaigning to
be stem in refusing such appointments to his creditors’ friends where,
on military grounds, he ought to have done so. The ‘scientia et usus
militnm' (a. ao.) was to supply all such shortcomings. See Cic ad
Fam. 7. 8.

32- alius alia eausa illata, ‘alleging severally all kinds os causes!
What would be the full constructioni '

necessariam, ‘indispensable’

33. ut eius voluntate discedere liceretr as ‘liceo' means literally
‘to be lest’ (chap. 18, note 3), we see that the expression ‘that it might
be lest to them by his good will' is not so really pleonastic as it seems
to be (chap. 35, note a).

23. 1. nonnulli; chap. 36, note a.

a. neque meandum, &c., ‘were unable to command their countr-

nance, and sometimes even to restrain their tears.' They were Italians,
recollect.

3. abditi, middle voice; ‘hiding themselves?
