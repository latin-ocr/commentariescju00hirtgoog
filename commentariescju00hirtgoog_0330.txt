we have an indirect evidence in Dion (41. 30), who represents Caesar as
saying, ‘Who would not grieve if he saw Italy laid as thoroughly waste
asBritainl¹ See 5. 48, note 3.

backwards and forwerda* From this original meaning sprang also the
two senses of ‘provision’ and ‘furlough’

ar. neque ulludesideraretun an attempt to prove that the ‘pristina
fortuna' which had been so rudely shaken, was now returning. See 4. 26,
note 5.

‘loca maxime frumentaria’ of 1. 10, but evidently iu the parts where he
expected a rebellion to arise, ,

the second British campaign3 Caesar having appointed him in order to
win his eminent brother to his cause; or, rather, as Mommsen suggests,
by way os guarantee that neither of the brothers should plot against
him.

in Remum the principle os the arrangement os these troops is
easily discernible. Durocortum or Rheims was their central point. (See
the map illustrating boolr ii.) The legion there was supported in the
rear by the three at Amiens (Samarobriva), arrd elsewhere. Labienus
was out in the Ardennes direction, Cicero pushed forward to the Sambre,
near Waterloo, and Sabinus and Cotta still sarther, probably to Tongres,
in tlre Meuse valley. These latter divisions lay along what was aster-
wards, arrd probably then, the great line of road from Rheims, by Gem-

· bloux, Tongres, arrd Juliers, to the Rhine at Cologne. For the quarters
os Cotta and Sabinus, see the notes on 6. 32, and the map at 4. r.

³²· quaestoribus. The three words ‘legatis et quaestoribus’ may
be a gloss; as, though Caesar had three provinces, he is unlikely to have
had with him at the same time the quaestor 'ol more than one province.
The quaestor, however, was not untrequently placed in military com·
