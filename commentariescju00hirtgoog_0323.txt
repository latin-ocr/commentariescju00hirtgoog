16. portum Itium. This has been assumed, in the notes to book iv„
, to be the sarne as Gessoriacum or Boulogne. The evidence from the
roads which converge upon this town in the itineraries ol Gaul is in fact
irresistible. The variety in the name may be accounted lor by the neigh-
bourhood of the Ἴκιον ἄκρον, or Cape Grisnez. It has also been remarked
(Lewin p. 23), that there is a village called Isques‚ on the Liane, near
the head oi Boulogneharbour. The supposed resemblance between this
name Itius and Witsand is illusory. The latter name is Dutch, meaning
simply ‘white saud ς’ not Celtic.

Celtic (Prichard, Hist. ol Manlrind, vol. 3, p. 132.); therefore the Tre·

St. Jemme, who had lived at' Treves, eud also heard the Gauls in Asia
Minor; and who asseris that the two languages are the same. For the
position oi the Treveri, see the map at 4. ι.
