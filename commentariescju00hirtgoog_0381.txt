seven modii, as a modius fetched about three und a hart sesterces at this
time (Verr. 3. 70). A modius, again, contained ociosos corn; there-

23. tot milio nummum. in words like ‘mille’ the second 1 is dropped

Π the reodin'g is correct (which is improbable, as ‘tot’ is not used ior
‘totidem '), the donative ol a centurion was ten times that ol a private:
whilehisregular proportior was only twiceas much (Livy 45. 40). Some
editors‘resd ‘duplicem summum? Kroner ingeniously proposes ‘ad ιιι
milio' (one MS. has 'ad ii ’). This would be 48‚oco sesterces tc be,
divided among the 120 centuricns, at the rate cs 400 each.
