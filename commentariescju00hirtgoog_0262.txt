rnoran 1. 8-12. 215

Anu. 11. 25, ‘soli Gallorum (Aedui) fraternitatis nomen cum populo
Romano usurpant! Lucan Phars. 1. 4231· speaks of the Arverni as
‘ausi latio se fingere fratres
ἱ Sanguine ab Iliaco populi!
He perhaps confounds the Arverni with the Aedui; and the legend was

probably invented as a Roman explanation of the Gallie idea of brother· '

hiood, which signified close political and military federation, not common
escent.

33. Aedui Ambarri, that is, the Aedui round the Arar or Saone. The ’

main body of the nation were on the east of the middle Loire. Their
dominions contained Bibracte (Autun), the great dmidical capital, and
· Noviodunum (Nevers), one of the great commercial cities of Gaul.

7. 1. necessarii, ‘close connections: ἀναγκαῖοι. Hence ‘necessitudo’ for
‘friendship' It was remarked at Rome, as a peculiarity in Caesar’s
style, that ,he used the word ‘necessitas ' in the sense of·ne0essitndo'

(Meyer. Orat. Rom. Fragm. p. 41²)·

a. sese depopulatis agris, δια, ‘that their lands had been ravaged,
and that now they could hardly keep the enemy from their walls!

5. nihil esse reliqum a partitive genitive, like Livy 34. 49, ‘nec
quidquam iis pensi est, quid faciant· ’

9. o. 12. flumen est Arar, δια, ‘the Saone is a riverwhieh tlows.'&c. .

10. incredibili lenitate ¹3 as compared with the Rhone, Adige, Po,
or Tiher, the Saone would seem very slow in its course. Caesar knew
no streams ‘waving their lazy lilies.’

15. de tertia vigilia, ‘in the course of the third watch’ The pas·
sage was at Villefranche, or thereabouts. See 16, note a.

27. eius soceri. L. Calp. Piso, father of that Calpurnia who is
familiar to us from Shakspeare. For the word ‘pagus' see 4. ι, note 5,
and for ‘eiua’ a. 15, note 3. The Tigurini have become the prominent
subject.

iniurias: Pliny, Suetonius, and later writers use this word in the
simple sense of ‘ damage! That Caesar here uses it in its proper sense,
of damage done contrary to law, will be evident from a comparison of
chap. 14. See the notes on that chapter. The assumption here is that
all offensive war against Romans is necessarily w'rong; combined with a
second that it becomes a Roman family to maintain generation after
generation, the same attitude towards particular foreign nations. This
would sometimes be kindly and protective (Dict. Antiq. Art. nosnrrrurr ad
fin), sometimes hostile, as in the case of the Flaminini towards Greece.

¹ Dr. Pricbard derives the name of Arar from the Celtic ‘ arav,’ ‘gentle'
(ipsuis), and that of the Garonne from ‘garw,' ‘rough,' ‘imperuoua'
