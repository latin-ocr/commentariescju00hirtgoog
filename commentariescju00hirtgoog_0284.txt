there still. But, meanwhile, these legions had been withdrawn, and
crussing the space of three miles, unobserwed by the enemy, had joined
the four legions belonging to the larger camp, and made an* attack on
Ariovistus' position before be could call in his detachments. Of course
the successful execution of such a stratagem depended larg'ely upon the
perfect steadiness behind ramparts of the two legions who had first
occupied the smaller camp (thus being left in the rear), and then executed
the hazardous movement from camptu camp. This explanation is due
to Jules Cesar, vol. 2, p. 91.

31. i. quod minus valebat. Thus Nipperdey and'Kraner wish
to read, but for the more authorised reading ‘quo minus,’ see 4. a,
note 1, and compare the Greek positive ὅσῳπερ ἀλγῶ, Soph. Trach. 313.

η. c.52. quaestorem· properly, a civil and finance officer, but
available for command (5. 25l,

was occupied by the Harudes. ’ ’

19. phalange facta, ‘who' bad rapidly adopted the phalanx sonna*
tion,’ that is, one in dense bodies of from 300 to 400 men (Jules Cesar,
p. 92). Orosius¹ explanation is. that they formed a kind of tortoise,
with their shields over their heads; and that some of the Roman
soldiers sprang actually on this roof of shields. But this seems im-
probable; for such a defensive arrangement would be suicidal as a
. mode of resisting an attack with swords, although it might answer as
against javelins.

ar. scuta manibus revellerent; instead of following the ordinary
practice of p'usbing their shields under that of their enemy, and wound-
ing him from beneath (which they could do without abandoning their
own guard), they grasped the top of the enemies' shields and struck
from above. ’ 1

authorities that ⁶ quinquaginta’ should be read here for .‘ quinque.'
